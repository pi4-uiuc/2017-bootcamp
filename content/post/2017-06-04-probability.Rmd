beta         | beta   | shape1, shape2, ncp 
Binomial     | binom  | size, prob
Cauchy       | cauchy | location, scale 
chi-squared  | chisq  | df, ncp
exponential  | exp    | rate
F            | f      | df1, df2, ncp
gamma        | gamma  | shape, scale 
geometric    | geom   | prob
hypergeometric | hyper | m, n, k 
log-normal   | lnorm  | meanlog, sdlog 
logistic     | logis  | location, scale 
Negative binomial | nbinom | size, prob
normal       | norm   | mean, sd
Poisson      | pois   | lambda
Student's t  | t      | df, ncp
uniform      | unif   | min, max 
Weibull      | weibull | shape, scale 
Wilcoxon     | wilcox | m, n



* "d" = density: probability density function (PDF)
* "p" = cumulative distribution function (CDF)
* "q" = quantile: calculates the value associated with a specified tail probability, inverse of "p"
* “r” = random: simulates random numbers
