Version control makes it possible to have 'unlimited undo' and histories of your documents (and some smaller datasets)

Having everything on a website like GitHub (or Bitbucket or GitLab) makes it easy to share with other people and collaborate. 
If you keep all of your important programs and files somewhere in the cloud, like on box.com, dropbox, github, it make it easier to use heterogeneous environments. 


## Version Control [SWC Git Novice 1-6](http://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice/)

### Getting Started


Introduce yourself

```sh
git config --global user.name "Firstname Lastname"
git config --global user.email you@yourdomain.example.com
```

If you want your contributions to be recognized:

> Scott Rohde, Carl Crott, mulroony, David LeBauer, Jeremy Kemball, Rob Kooper, Jimmy Chen, andrewshirk, Zhengqi Yang, Max Burnette, MarvinJ, 董伊琳, Uday Saraf, The Gitter Badger and Michael Dietze (2016) “PecanProject/bety: BETYdb 4.13”. Zenodo. doi: 10.5281/zenodo.162409.

```sh
mkdir myproject
git init
git status
cat "my project" > README.md
git status
```

### commiting changes

You need to tell git which files to line up for the commit

```sh
git add README.md
git status
```


```sh
git commit -m "added README as first commit"
git status
```

### branching

```sh
git checkout -b first-script
```

This creates a new branch called your 'first script'. Now lets add something to it.

```sh
echo "!#/bin/bash \n echo 'hello world'" > myscript.sh
```

* What is `\n`?
* What does `$` do?

Now commit the changes:

```sh
git add myscript.sh
git commit -m 'added hello world script'
```

### Merging

```
git status
git log
git checkout master
git status
git merge first-script
git status
```

### Review 

```sh
git log --graph
```

## Git in Practice

This is a very common approach to using Git. It is described in a blog post by Vincent Dressen http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/. 


![image of git workflow](http://justinhileman.info/article/changing-history/git-flow.png)

We use this in the PEcAn Project. Here is a [list of branches](https://github.com/PecanProject/pecan/branches/all). Our documentation provides a [recommended git workflow](https://pecanproject.github.io/pecan-documentation/using-git.html#recommended-git-workflow) that includes a 'basic' and 'advanced' section. These are worth reading, and it is not necessary to include the content here.

Google is where you will often turn for help, and Google will often lead you to [Stackoverflow.com](https://stackoverflow.com). If you read through the most popular [stackoverflow questions tagged with 'git'](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/git) you will find solutions to most common problems.
