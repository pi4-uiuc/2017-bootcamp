<h2>Getting started with R</h2>
<p>Why R? * by design “a programming language and environment for statistical computing” * Most common language used by academic statisticians. Thus, many methods are developed as R packages and not available elsewhere. * built around stats, with lots of handy functions * data analysis by design * formulas for statistical models * ggplot ‘grammar of graphics’ among best graphing programs (only get better w/ graphical design programs like photoshop/Inkscape) * dplyr and tidyr for data munging * Integrates with lower level languages (esp C, C++, FORTRAN; Rcpp package for integration w/ C++ excellent) * can do anything * has a reputation for being slow. * It can’t be as fast as a compiled language (like C / FORTRAN) * Recent changes and new packages make it faster and better at handling big data (e.g. by leveraging back-end databases).</p>
<p>Why not R?</p>

<h2>Intro to Rstudio</h2>
<p>Rstudio is the best IDE for programming in R. Developed by the <a href="https://www.rstudio.com/">Rstudio</a> company, which leads the R community as a whole. Many leading R developers including Hadley Wickham (lead author of tidyverse, dplyr, ggplot2) and Yihui Xie (Rmarkdown, Shiny) work there. Now there are lots of ‘plugins’ that facilitate developing in R.</p>
<p>If you love emacs, try the emacs-ess package. Especially if you are mostly writing scripts. It is really quite awesome. However, it doesn’t compare to Rstudio once you start developing packages and writing reports or websites.</p>
<p>There are four panes (CCW from top left): * text editor * interactive environment * files/plots/packages/help/viewer * environment/history/build/git</p>
