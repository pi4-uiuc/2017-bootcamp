## Spreadsheets and Tables

A database is a generic term for data. Often these are divided into 'relational' and 'non-relational'... We will get to these later. First, lets start with Spreadsheets, which are a simple, and very common format for data.

In fact, so far we have been working with tables.

## Miscanthus Yields

https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1MNG5BH6oDaRH4Ii1ZO7tVRV7pTZRKPv81In1NFdLFbs
## Sorghum Data from Arizona

Lets start with a spreadsheet that was prepared by a colleague of mine, Maria Newcomb, in Arizona:

https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ESwAR2-BpQ2HfaCoSDCQaiBJVab_5sHawEltyYcLP8U

Let's review the pages

* README is good. They are well ahead of the curve on this!
* What additional information is here?
* Where is the data we want to look at?
* What information is redundant?


Download the table "PlantHeights_AllPlots" as CSV


## Data Cleaning

* In this lesson, we will use Open Refine to find errors, sort, and clean our dataset.
* Open the OpenRefine container in the NDSLabs workbench.

### About Open Refine

This tutorial is based on the [Data Carpentry Open Refine for Ecology lesson](http://www.datacarpentry.org/OpenRefine-ecology-lesson/01-working-with-openrefine/), modified to use our datasets.

You can learn more about and download Open Refine at [openrefine.org](https://openrefine.org).


### Importing Data into Open Refine

Once OpenRefine is launched in your browser, the left margin has options to `Create Project`, `Open Project`, or `Import Project`. Here we will create a new project:

* Click `Create Project`; `Get data from this computer` should be selected
   * what other ways can you get data into OpenRefine?
* Click `Choose Files` and select the file:
<p align="center">
 `DRAFT_Sorghum2_PlantHeights_AugustPlanting-training-sample - PlantHeights_AllPlots.csv`
</p>
* Click `Open` --> `Next`
* OpenRefine gives you a preview - a chance to show you it understood the file.
   * did the file show up sensibly?
* In the upper right corner create a meaningful project name and then click `Create Project`.

### Faceting

OpenRefine supports faceted browsing. This allows you to see the big picture of your data and then filter down to a subset of rows. Once you have a target set of rows, you can apply changes in bulk.

Let's work with one of the columns containing plant height measurements:

  * next to one of the numeric columns "Plant_ht_Aug24" click the arrow
  * `facet` --> `Numeric facet`.
    * what went wrong?
  * click `edit cells` --> `common transforms` --> `numeric`
  * now try to click `facet` --> `numeric` again
    * what do you see this time?
    * How is a numeric facet different than a text facet?
  * click "Plant_ht_Sep15"
    * how many rows are there with non-numeric data?
    * what to do here?

Let's look at the Genotype field:

* select the arrow next to the column named "Genotype"
* select `Facet` --> `Text Facet`
* sort by `count`
  * what do you notice?
  * What is the level of replication in this study?
  * Which genotypes are not like the others?
  * why are there so many genotypes named "Great Scott" and "border"?
* Let's clean up all whitespace problems
  * trim leading and trailing whitespace
  * trim consecutive white space
  * now how many groups do we have?
* Edit "border" --> "Border"

### TERRA REF Sites and Variables

Your turn:

Lets review a few datasets from the TERRA REF trait database. These are provided in the [.json format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON) by default:

1. Look at the sites table. Where are the sites? Are there redundant names?
   * import from https://terraref.ncsa.illinois.edu/bety/api/beta/sites?key=9999999999999999999999999999999999999999&limit=none
   * when you review the data, select the lowest level of hierarchy so column names aren't long concatenations of the entire tree.
2. See if you can find any redundant variables:   
  * import from https://terraref.ncsa.illinois.edu/bety/api/beta/variables.xml?key=9999999999999999999999999999999999999999&limit=none
  * note that this is in XML format (the BETYdb API provide json, xml, and csv)


##### Open Refine

* Let's look at the Miscanthus Yield dataset again
* `Open` --> `Create Project` --> `From URL`
  * Enter https://www.betydb.org/search.csv?search=Ayield
* What is the matter here? Let's clean up the imported dataset:
  * columns are csv
  * discard first 8 lines, parse next 1 line as column headers
  * parse cells to numbers, dates, etc
* `Create Project`

##### From a Web Interface

Go to [betydb.org](https://betydb.org) and enter "Miscanthus Yield" into the search box and click the search glass icon.

Let's review the information in this table:

* Site with city
* Date + time + timezone
* Species + common name
* Cultivar
* Trait
* Mean (with units)
* Method
* Entity

Now click the `Download Results` button. This will download a .csv file. A [.csv file](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values) is a table where each column is defined by a comma, e.g. a 3x3 matrix would be formatted thus:

```
row 1 col 1, row 1 col 2, row 1 col 3
row 2 col 1, row 2 col 2, row 2 col 3
row 3 col 1, row 3 col 2, row 3 col 3
```

_a brief note about csv files_

By default, many computers will open the csv file directly into a [spreadsheet program](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/spreadsheet) like Microsoft Excel or OpenOffice Calc. But because it is a text file, you can also open it in a [text editor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Text_editor) like Notepad, nano, or emacs.

It can also be easily read by any software or parsed at the command line using tools like `cut` and `sed`. Unlike xml and json, it is more intuitive for a human to read.

> where are there redundancies?

* Site + city + lat + lon
* Date + time + timezone
* genus + scientificname + common name
* Cultivar
* Trait + units & description
* Mean
* Method
* Entity

### Tidy data

Tidy data means that:
* Each variable forms a column.
* Each observation forms a row.
* Each type of observational unit forms a table.

From [tidyr vignette](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/tidyr/vignettes/tidy-data.html)

> Is the Miscanthus dataset tidy? What would we need to do to make it tidy?


## Relational Databases and SQL

Some of the following is based on the [Data Carpentry SQL Introduction for Ecology lesson](http://www.datacarpentry.org/sql-ecology-lesson/00-sql-introduction/).


The [relational model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relational_model) for managing databases consists of representing the data in terms of tuples of relations. Many modern databases use some version of this. Structured Query Language or [SQL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL) is a language implementation based on the relational model, although there are some differences.

### Data Normalization

"Codd's Normal Forms" from [Codd 1970](http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?doid=362384.362685):  

> process of organizing the columns (attributes) and tables (relations) of a relational database to reduce data redundancy and improve data integrity. [Wikipedia - Database normalization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database_normalization)

To motivate the use of a relational databases, let's start by looking at a table. We want to see if there is redundant information that violates the best practice of having a single canonical representation for each piece of information.

> Which of these fields has redundant data?

* SQL allows us to select and group subsets of data, do math and other calculations, and combine data.
* A relational database is made up of tables which are related to each other by shared keys.
  * primary keys
  * foreign keys
  * natural keys
* Different database management systems (DBMS) use slightly different vocabulary, but they are all based on the same ideas.

> How would you begin to normalize this data set?

### Let's look at the underlying database

#### Connecting to a database server

To connect to a database server you need the following connection parameters:

* host
* login
* user
* database (database name)

Let's connect to the terraref instance of betydb. Until now we have been accessing betydb.org. Now we will access (a copy of) the database behind `terraref.ncsa.illinois.edu/bety`

From the command line:

```sh
psql -U bety -d bety -h terra-bety.default
```

The hidden .pgpass file:

```sh
echo "terra-bety.default:5432:bety:bety:bety" >> ~/.pgpass
chmod 0600 ~/.pgpass # why?
psql
```

Open the PostgreSQL application in the NDSLabs workbench and enter the connection parameters:
```
Host: terra-bety.default
Port: 5432
User: bety
Password: bety
DB: bety
```

To connect in R and RMarkdown use:

```{r dbcon-1}
library(RPostgreSQL)
dbcon <- dbConnect(RPostgreSQL::PostgreSQL(),
                dbname = "bety",
                password = 'bety',
                host = 'terra-bety.default',
                user = 'bety',
                port = 5432)
```

You can run the following from RMarkdown:
```sql
REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW traitsview_private;
REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW yieldsview_private;
REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW traits_and_yields_view_private;
REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW traits_and_yields_view;
```

### Tables & Schemas

This is an entity-relationship diagram:

![A simplified entity–relationship diagram for key tables in Biofuel Ecophysiological Traits and Yields database (BETYdb).](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ebimodeling/betydb_manuscript/master/figures/gcbb12420-fig-0001.png)


Here is a more comprehensive entity-relationship diagram:

![BETYdb Schema ER diagram](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PecanProject/betydb-data-access/master/betydb_schema.png)


### SQL

Let's start using some basic SQL Commands from the following list:

```sql
SELECT
WHERE
JOIN
DISTINCT
LIMIT
ORDER BY
GROUP BY
AND
OR
MIN
MAX
AVG
SUM
COUNT
LIKE
```

`Select` can be used to view from a table, the symbol `*` is a wildcard:

```{sql connection = dbcon}
select * from traits limit 10;
select * from traits where mean < 0;
```

`select distinct` can also be used:

```{sql distinct, connection = dbcon}
select distinct trait from traits_and_yields_view;
```

We can also group what we view and organize them:

```{sql sql-group-order, connection = dbcon}
select sitename, count(*) as n
   from traits_and_yields_view
   group by sitename order by n desc;
```


### Types of Joins

Joins are used to put together tables in different ways:

![types of joins](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/diagrams/join-venn.png)

From [Grolemund and Wickham "R for Data Science"](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/relational-data.html)

An example:

```{sql NDVI, connection = dbcon}
select name, units, date, mean from traits left join variables
   on traits.variable_id = variables.id
   where variables.name = 'NDVI'
```

> Write queries that will
>    1. join the sites table to the traits table
>    2. join the managements table to the traits table

### Other handy features

#### Quality control

Lets look at this in the PostgreSQL studio

* constraints
  * foreign key
  * primary key
  * uniqueness
  * check
* data types
  * numeric, int,
  * character, enum
  * geometry
* natural keys


#### With

```{sql connection = dbcon}
With NDVI as
  (select name, units, date, mean from traits left join variables
     on traits.variable_id = variables.id
     where variables.name = 'NDVI'
  )
  select * from NDVI;
```


#### Views

* Views (stored queries)
  * Materialized views (pre-computed queries)

```sql
drop view if exists NDVI;

create view NDVI as
select * from traits_and_yields_view_private
    where trait = 'NDVI';

select * from NDVI;
```

## Database Management Systems

### Common software

MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, Access(?!)


### R: RPostgreSQL and dplyr

```{r rpostgresql}
library(RPostgreSQL)

dbcon <- dbConnect(RPostgreSQL::PostgreSQL(),
                dbname = "bety", password = 'bety', host = 'terra-bety.default', user = 'bety', port = 5432)

query <- "select * from traits left join variables
             on traits.variable_id = variables.id
             where variables.name = 'NDVI';"
#query <- "select count(*) from traits_and_yields_view_private"
#dbSendQuery(dbcon, 'select count(*) from traits;'))
result <- dbSendQuery(dbcon, query)
df <- fetch(result)
dbClearResult(result)
dbDisconnect(dbcon)
```


#### Connecting with dplyr

Using the [dplyr library](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/dplyr/vignettes/databases.html) has the advantage for larger datasets that one can do a lot of server-side summarization and some computing before pulling data into memory.

Here is an example of its use:

```{r dplyr-dbcon}
library(dplyr)

bety_src <- src_postgres(dbname = "bety",
                        password = 'bety',
                        host = 'terra-bety.default',
                        user = 'bety',
                        port = 5432)

#translate_sql()
```

```{r complex-query}
treatments <- tbl(bety_src, 'treatments') %>%
  select(treatment_id = id , name, definition, control)

managements_treatments <- tbl(bety_src, 'managements_treatments')

managements <- tbl(bety_src, 'managements') %>%
  filter(mgmttype %in% c('Fertilization_N', 'Planting', 'Irrigation')) %>%
  select(management_id = id, date, mgmttype, level, units) %>%
  left_join(managements_treatments, by = 'management_id') %>%
  left_join(treatments, by = 'treatment_id')

planting <-managements %>%
  filter(mgmttype == "Planting") %>%
  select(treatment_id, planting_date = date, nrate = level)

heights <- tbl(bety_src, 'traits_and_yields_view') %>%
  filter(trait %in% c('plant_height', 'canopy_height')) %>%
  left_join(planting, by = 'treatment_id') %>%  
  collect %>%
  mutate(age = as.Date(raw_date) - planting_date)

library(ggplot2)
ggplot(data = heights, aes(raw_date, mean)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.1) +
  facet_wrap(~trait, scales = 'free')
```

### APIs

The data at teraref can also be accessed via an API:

* sign into terraref.ncsa.illinois.edu/bety
  * username: `pi4-student`
  * password: `ask-instructor`

* locate your API key and copy it

* see [terraref tutorials 01- betydb getting started](https://github.com/terraref/tutorials/blob/master/traits/00-BETYdb-getting-started.Rmd)

* API Documentation terraref.ncsa.illinois.edu/bety/api/beta/docs

#### restful interface

get put delete
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer

#### json data structures

Another way of getting the data is via [JSON](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON).


### R traits package

Example on querying indoor data from terraref database using the R traits package can be found at:

https://github.com/terraref/tutorials/blob/master/traits/02-danforth-phenotyping-facility.Rmd


## Real World Examples

### Advanced: BETYdb

* Full Schema betydb.org/schemas
* How would you query all of the planting dates associated with a trait record?

### Real World Application: the Biofuel Ecophysiological Traits and Yields database

We have created 'views' to make it easier to query data from multiple tables. For example, to lookup the name and location of a site or the names and units of variables. The following query joins multiple tables, and is based on the yieldsview table:

```sql
SELECT 'yields'::character(10) AS result_type,
    yields.id,
    yields.citation_id,
    yields.site_id,
    yields.treatment_id,
    sites.sitename,
    sites.city,
    st_y(st_centroid(sites.geometry)) AS lat,
    st_x(st_centroid(sites.geometry)) AS lon,
    species.scientificname,
    species.commonname,
    species.genus,
    species.id AS species_id,
    yields.cultivar_id,
    citations.author,
    citations.year AS citation_year,
    treatments.name AS treatment,
    yields.date,
    date_part('month'::text, yields.date) AS month,
    date_part('year'::text, yields.date) AS year,
    variables.name AS trait,
    variables.description AS trait_description,
    yields.mean,
    variables.units,
    yields.n,
    yields.statname,
    yields.stat,
    yields.notes,
   FROM ((((((yields
     LEFT JOIN sites ON ((yields.site_id = sites.id)))
     LEFT JOIN species ON ((yields.specie_id = species.id)))
     LEFT JOIN citations ON ((yields.citation_id = citations.id)))
     LEFT JOIN treatments ON ((yields.treatment_id = treatments.id)))
     LEFT JOIN variables ON (((variables.name)::text = 'Ayield'::text)))
     LEFT JOIN users ON ((yields.user_id = users.id)));

```
