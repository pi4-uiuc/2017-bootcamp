## 2017 PI4 Computational Bootcamp

This site includes material for the 2017 PI4 Computational Bootcamp taught to students in the Department of Mathematics, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.

The 2017 PI4 computational Bootcamp was held May 26 - June 9, 2017 in 239 Altgeld Hall.

The bootcamp is a two-week long course for for PI4 students prior to beginning summer internships as part of the NSF funded [PI4 Program for Interdisciplinary and Industrial Internships at Illinois](https://pi4.math.illinois.edu/). 

This year the focus shifted to the use and analysis of large and complex data.
In previous years, courses focused more on numerical analysis. Materials from [2016](http://www.math.uiuc.edu/~hirani/cbmg/index.html), [2015](http://math.illinois.edu/~shahkar2/cbmg/), [2014](http://www.math.uiuc.edu/~hirani/teaching/cbmgsu14) are available through these links.

## Funding

PI4 is an NSF-funded award from the Division of Mathematical Sciences, in the Mentoring Through Critical Transition Points program; award 1345032.
