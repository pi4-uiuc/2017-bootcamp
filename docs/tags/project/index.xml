      <description>Objectives Students should experience a collaborative development cycle similar to what they might encounter as a research programmer / software engineer / data scientist etc.
They will have the opportunity to contribute to open source projects (e.g.Â TERRA REF and PEcAn Projects). Their GitHub repositories, reports, and code will become part of their portfolio.
Projects will provide the opportunity for students to apply what we have learned in class to new datasets and analyses.</description>
