### Data Normalization

To motivate the use of a relational databases, lets start by looking at a table. 

:point_right: Go to [betydb.org](https://betydb.org) and enter "Miscanthus Yield" into the search box and click the search glass icon.

Lets review the information in this table.

* Site with city
* Date + time + timezone
* Species + common name 
* Cultivar
* Trait 
* Mean (with units)
* Method
* Entity

Now click the "Download Results" button. This will download a .csv file. A .csv file is a table where each column is defined by a comma, e.g. a 3x3 matrix would be formatted thus:

```
row 1 col 1, row 1 col 2, row 1 col 3
row 2 col 1, row 2 col 2, row 2 col 3
row 3 col 1, row 3 col 2, row 3 col 3
```

_a brief note about csv files_

By default, many computers will open the csv file directly into a [spreadsheet program](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/spreadsheet) like Microsoft Excel or OpenOffice Calc. But because it is a text file, you can also open it in a [text editor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Text_editor) like Notepad, nano, or emacs.

It can also be easily read by any software or parsed at the command line using tools like `cut` and `sed`. Unlike xml and json, it is more intuitive for a human to read.

![Summary BETYdb schema](https://pecan.gitbooks.io/betydb-data-access/content/betydb_schema.png)

We have created 'views' to make it easier to query data from multiple tables. For example, to lookup the name and location of a site or the names and units of variables. The following query joins multiple tables, and is based on the yieldsview table:

```sql
SELECT 'yields'::character(10) AS result_type,
    yields.id,
    yields.citation_id,
    yields.site_id,
    yields.treatment_id,
    sites.sitename,
    sites.city,
    st_y(st_centroid(sites.geometry)) AS lat,
    st_x(st_centroid(sites.geometry)) AS lon,
    species.scientificname,
    species.commonname,
    species.genus,
    species.id AS species_id,
    yields.cultivar_id,
    citations.author,
    citations.year AS citation_year,
    treatments.name AS treatment,
    yields.date,
    date_part('month'::text, yields.date) AS month,
    date_part('year'::text, yields.date) AS year,
    variables.name AS trait,
    variables.description AS trait_description,
    yields.mean,
    variables.units,
    yields.n,
    yields.statname,
    yields.stat,
    yields.notes,
   FROM ((((((yields
     LEFT JOIN sites ON ((yields.site_id = sites.id)))
     LEFT JOIN species ON ((yields.specie_id = species.id)))
     LEFT JOIN citations ON ((yields.citation_id = citations.id)))
     LEFT JOIN treatments ON ((yields.treatment_id = treatments.id)))
     LEFT JOIN variables ON (((variables.name)::text = 'Ayield'::text)))
     LEFT JOIN users ON ((yields.user_id = users.id)));
     
```
